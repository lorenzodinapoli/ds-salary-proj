# ds-salary-proj
repo for end-to-end data scientist salary prediction

	- Created a tool to estimate data scientist salaries to help data scientist negotiate their salary
	- Engineered features from text of each job description to quantify the value companies put on skills such as python, R, spark, and excel
	- Optimized linear, Lasso, and Random Forest Regressor using Random Search CV (preferred over Grid Search CV for running time optimization)
		to reach the best model
	- Built a client facing API using Flask.
